# Wind Chill Calculator

## Usage

Follow the instructions on the [main project page](./README.md) to get it on your system.

After you've launched the program, you can now enter: 
1. the current temperature
1. the current wind speed
1. whether you are using Imperial (°F/mph) or Metric (°C/kph)

Clicking on "Calculate" will return the current wind chill temperature.
